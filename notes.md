The code you've provided doesn't work because React components must return their JSX synchronously. In your case, you're trying to return JSX after a delay using `setTimeout`, which is asynchronous. This approach won't work in React for several reasons:

1. **React expects immediate return**: When React calls your component function, it expects to get JSX back immediately to render. Your function doesn't return anything initially (it returns `undefined`), and the setTimeout callback's return value is ignored.

2. **setTimeout doesn't work this way**: The return value of the function you pass to setTimeout is not used - it's completely ignored by JavaScript.

Here's how you can properly implement a delayed render in React:

```jsx
function Page() {
  const [showContent, setShowContent] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setShowContent(true);
    }, 8000);

    return () => clearTimeout(timer); // Cleanup on unmount
  }, []);

  if (!showContent) {
    return null; // or return a loading spinner/skeleton
  }

  return (
    <p>hello ubeey from invoices</p>
  );
}

export default Page;
```

This works because:
1. We use React's state to track when to show the content
2. We use `useEffect` to set up the timer when the component mounts
3. We properly clean up the timer when the component unmounts
4. We return `null` or a loading state initially, then the actual content after the delay

Alternatively, if you're using Next.js and want to delay the entire page load, you should handle this at a higher level (like in a layout component or with a loading state in your routing).
